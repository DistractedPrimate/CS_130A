These are my projects for CS 130A, 1/2 of UCSB's Data Structures and Algorithms series. All the code is written in C++. To use, run the Prog file with a string of commands calling the functions of the data structures. For Example "search rat insert muscle" would search for rat and insert muscle.

Project 1: Hash Table and Binary Search Tree
Project 2: Min Max Heap
Project 3: AVL Tree and Two Five Tree
